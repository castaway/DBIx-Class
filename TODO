 - Create a DBIx::Class::FilterColumn to replace inflate/deflate. This 
   component would provide a new syntax for filtering column update and 
   retrieval through a simple syntax. The syntax would be:
   __PACKAGE__->add_columns(phone => { set=>sub{ ... }, get=>sub{ ... } }); 
   We should still support the old inflate/deflate syntax, but this new 
   way should be recommended.

 - Extract DBIC::SQL::Abstract into a separate module for CPAN
 - Chop PK::Auto::Foo up to have PK::Auto refer to an appropriate
   DBIx::Storage::DBI::Foo, which will be loaded on connect from Driver info?
 - Add deploy method to Schema, which will create DB tables from Schema, via
   SQLT
