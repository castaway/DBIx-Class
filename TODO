  - set_from_related should take undef
  - ResultSource objects caching ->resultset causes interesting problems
  - find why XSUB dumper kills schema in Catalyst (may be Pg only?)

 - using PK::Auto should set is_auto_increment for the PK columns, so that copy() "just works"
 - docs of copy() should say that is_auto_increment is essential for auto_incrementing keys

  - Refactor ResultSet::new to be less hairy
    - we should move the setup of select, as, and from out of here
      - these should be local rs attrs, not main attrs, and extra joins
        provided on search should be merged
  - find a way to un-wantarray search without breaking compat
  - audit logging component
  - delay relationship setup if done via ->load_classes
  - double-sided relationships
  - incremental deploy
  - make short form of class specifier in relationships work

 - Create a DBIx::Class::FilterColumn to replace inflate/deflate. This 
   component would provide a new syntax for filtering column update and 
   retrieval through a simple syntax. The syntax would be:
   __PACKAGE__->add_columns(phone => { set=>sub{ ... }, get=>sub{ ... } }); 
   We should still support the old inflate/deflate syntax, but this new 
   way should be recommended.

 - Extract DBIC::SQL::Abstract into a separate module for CPAN
 - Chop PK::Auto::Foo up to have PK::Auto refer to an appropriate
   DBIx::Storage::DBI::Foo, which will be loaded on connect from Driver info?
(done -> 0.06001!)
 - Add deploy method to Schema, which will create DB tables from Schema, via
   SQLT
(sorta done)

 - Support table locking.

 - When subclassing a dbic class make it so you don't have to do 
   __PACKAGE__->table(__PACKAGE__->table()); for the result set to 
   return the correct object type.

 Add the ability for deploy to be given a directory and grab <dbname>.sql 
 out of there if available. Try SQL::Translator if not. If none of the above, 
 cry (and die()).  Then you can have a script that pre-gens for all available 
 SQLT modules so an app can do its own deploy without SQLT on the target 
 system

 Add the search attributes "limit" and "rows_per_page".
 limit: work as expected just like offset does
 rows_per_page: only be used if you used the page attr or called $rs->page
 rows: modify to be an alias that gets used to populate either as appropriate, 
       if you haven't specified one of the others
